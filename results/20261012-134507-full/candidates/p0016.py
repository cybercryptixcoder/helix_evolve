# Helix feature policy | trial of f0011 tight_fit_small_jobs_in_full_bins
# priority() = sum over features of (weight x scale) . feature(item, bins, capacity); the weights were fitted
# by an optimiser. With every weight at 0 all bins tie and the simulator picks the oldest bin that fits
# (first fit), so the empty policy is Code Zero.
